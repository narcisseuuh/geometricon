## Idea
I am currently studying "Introduction to Static Analysis" by Xavier Rival and Kwangyeuk Yi. In the first parts of the book, they focus on analysis by abstract interpretation of a language for geometry in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In this repository, I am trying to implement a basic analyzer for it, following the details presented in the book.
The name of the project was inspired by a mathematical cartoon written by Jean Pierre Petit that one of my teachers of mathematics always praised to us, and also because the language presented didn't have a name.

## Building the project

To build the project, you can run :
```sh
make
```
and then to install it, you can run :
```sh
make install
```
You will then have installed the binaries `interpreter` and `analyzer` which provides both the interpretation for the language and its analysis.

### Parsed BNF Grammar

The parsed BNF grammar of the language is as follows:
```bnf
program ::=
    init ';' stmt_list EOF
    ;

init ::=
    'init' '(' set 'Ã—' set ')'
    ;

set ::=
    '[' INT ',' INT ']'
    ;

stmt_list ::=
    stmt (';' stmt)*
    ;

stmt ::=
    operation
    | '{' stmt_list '}' 'or' '{' stmt_list '}'
    | 'iter' '{' stmt_list '}'
    ;

operation ::=
    'translation' '(' INT ',' INT ')'
    | 'rotation' '(' INT ',' INT ',' INT ')'
    ;
```
